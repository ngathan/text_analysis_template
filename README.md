# Text Data Templates

This repo contains R scripts for cleaning and preparing text data for further analysis. The templates here would help researchers to further conduct Word2Vec, topic modeling (structural topic modeling, or LDA).   

In general my text-data-cleaning process is as follows: 

1. remove emojis 
2. remove URLs 
3. remove language(s) that you don't use in the final analysis 
4. remove spams
